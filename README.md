Welcome to Aphaesel, aiming to be a set of plugins working together, as well as independently. The core will exist of infrastructure and interfaces defining modifications like special arrows, magic, money, etc. Every interface will go with a manager, to make life of the developer of plugins for a certain modification easier. Everything, except the interfaces, can be swapped in every way someone likes. This means ultimate flexibility. However, everything will be supplied as well if you just want to get it running.

The parts can and will depend on each other, like magic depends on mana, and trade depends on money. Hereunder is a tree.
TODO: the tree.
